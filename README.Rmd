# resourcecodedata

This a data-only R package. It contains the **Resourcecode** hindcast database configuration data, that is used to run the WWIIIâ“‡ model:
nodes locations for both the sea-state parameters, examples of time series of 1D and 2D surface elevation variance spectral density, etc. These are static data that will **never** be updated.

For more on using these data, see the GitHub repository for the [resourcecode](https://github.com/Resourcecode-project/r-resourcecode) package, which is built to interact with data in this package.
