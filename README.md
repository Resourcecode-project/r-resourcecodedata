# resourcecodedata

This a data-only R package. It contains the **Resourcecode** hindcast
database configuration data, that is used to run the WWIIIâ“‡ model: nodes
locations for both the sea-state parameters, examples of time series of
1D and 2D surface elevation variance spectral density and summary
statistics computed on the whole covered area and time period. These are
static data that will **never** be updated.

For more on using these data, see the GitHub repository for the
[Resourcecode](https://github.com/Resourcecode-project/r-resourcecode)
package, which is built to interact with data in this package.
